# PHPunctional: Functional Programming Library For PHP #

**Actual documentation and more examples coming soon**

This library was created as a test to see how far I could push PHP into the functional programming territory... and
to be honest I'm surprised with the result.

## Highlights: ##
- Validation Applicative
- Maybe Monad
- Either Monad
- All functions are curried
- Collection API to work on arrays

Some [examples](https://github.com/r-cyr/PHPunctional/tree/master/P/Examples) are available

## Remaining things to do: ##
- Documentation in Markdown format
- More comments in code
- Tests for Arithmetic/Relational/Boolean
